 -- Changes:
	Support for synthesis and simulation;
	Memory structured with two architectures, block ram for synthesis, common description for simulation;
	Data Path now sensitive to falling edge clock (clk_n);
	Micro operations changed, status flag group now execute in 2 cycles;
	Removed instruction port from data path
	Removed wrIR control signal, no longer necessary;
	
 -- Problems:
	Address is not changing in proper timing
