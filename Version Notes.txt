 -- Changes:
 
	Support for synthesis and simulation;
	Memory structured with two architectures, block ram for synthesis, common description for simulation;
	Data Path now sensitive to falling edge clock (clk_n);
	Bus control is now done with multiplexers instead of tri-states (better for synthesis);
	Added Memory Address Register(MAR) to Data Path, ADL and ADH are now used as temporary registers;
	Removed "instruction" port from data path;
	Removed uins.wrIR control signal, no longer necessary;
	Added support for al status flag change group instructions (2 cycles);
