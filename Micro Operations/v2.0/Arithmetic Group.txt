Fetch Step
  PC = 0503     (adc $2043 instruction  4 cycles) AABS
    MAR<-[PC]   Place PC contents on address bus, signal read required.
    MBR<-M[MAR] Read opcode = 8a into data register from memory.
    IR<-[MBR]   Move opcode to instruction register.
    PC<-[PC]+1  Increment PC. PC = 0504  

                Decode opcode - next 2 bytes are address of needed data.

  PC = 0504  
    MAR<-[PC]   Place PC contents on address bus, signal read required.
    MBR<-M[MAR] Fetch byte = 43 into data register.
    TL<-[MBR]   Move retrieved data into lower half of 2 byte temp register.
    PC<-[PC]+1  Increment PC. PC = 0505  

  PC = 0505  
    MAR<-[PC]   Place PC contents on address bus, signal read required.
    MBR<-M[MAR] Fetch byte = 20 into data register.
    TH<-[MBR]   Move retrieved data into upper half of 2 byte temp register.
    PC<-[PC]+1  Increment PC. PC = 0506  

Execute Step
    MAR<-[TH/TL]  Move combined address to memory address register.
    MBR<-M[MAR]   Fetch byte at memory 2043 into data register.
    AC<-[AC]+MBR  Add data to Accumulator
    AC<-[AC]+CC[C] Add carry if set.
                  For 6502, programmer is responsible for setting initial value
                  of carry register before performing math.

    Change CC   Set various flags as appropriate after completing both adds.
                N Z C I D V  Negative, zero, carry, and overflow affected.
